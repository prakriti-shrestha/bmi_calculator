# BMI Calculator

A beautiful, multi-screen Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built with Flutter. This project focuses on creating a custom, designer-inspired user interface to demonstrate Flutter's flexibility in UI development.

## About this project

The goal was to move beyond standard widgets and build a fully custom UI based on the beautiful designs of [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). The result is a simple, functional BMI calculator with a strong focus on custom styling, multi-page navigation, and a polished user experience.

This project was an opportunity to practice and master several key Flutter and Dart concepts:

* **Custom UI Development:** Building a unique interface from scratch by heavily customizing Flutter widgets.
* **Theming & Branding:** Using Flutter themes to create a coherent and branded look and feel with custom color palettes (using hex codes).
* **Multi-Page Navigation:** Creating a multi-screen app using Flutter's `Navigator` and named `Routes`.
* **Widget Refactoring:** Extracting UI into smaller, reusable widgets to maintain clean and organized code.
* **State Management:** Passing functions as parameters to manage state between widgets.
* **Gesture Detection:** Using the `GestureDetector` widget to handle user input beyond simple taps.
* **Core Dart Concepts:**
    * Understanding and using Dart **Enums**.
    * Applying the **Ternary Operator** for concise conditional logic.
    * Grasping the difference between `const` and `final` and their practical use cases.
* **Composition over Inheritance:** Embracing the Flutter way of building UI through widget composition.
